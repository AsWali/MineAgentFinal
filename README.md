# ðŸª“ MineAgent (Implementation from "MineDojo")

This repository contains the **open-source implementation** of **MineAgent** from the [MineDojo paper (Fan et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08853). The authors described the agentâ€™s architecture but did not release complete codeâ€”this repo fills that gap.

## ðŸ“Œ What is MineAgent?

MineAgent is a hierarchical agent designed for open-ended tasks in Minecraft. It integrates:
- A **language-conditioned policy**
- A **skill selector** trained on human data
- A **low-level controller** that executes atomic actions

The agent can solve diverse tasks ranging from crafting tools to navigating terrain, using natural language instructions as input.
